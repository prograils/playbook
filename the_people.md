### Team:

We aim not to grow with more than 30 people onboard (the reason you’ll find in ‘Values’ section. Right now our team consists of 23 members, so if you’d like to join us, you’d better hurry up.

### Recruitment:

Right now we’re looking for experienced Ruby on Rails developers. If you think you’re a good fit, tell us something about you at hello@prograils.com

### Career:

After joining us, the first three months will be your ‘trial’ during which we’ll see if we understand each other and are on the same page. As remote working is fine, this is the time you should spend with us in the office. We don’t have any career paths or employer yearly reviews. The rule is simple, you will be properly rewarded for your work, accordingly your commitment and skills.

### Work environment:

Most people hate open spaces, well, we hate them too. Our spacious office is divided into separate rooms, everyone in our office has their own private zone around the desk. We guarantee the most comfortable working conditions, everyone is equipped with high-quality headphones, large size adjustable-height standing/sitting desks and as many monitors and other hardware as one needs. Stability balls, adjustable desks and ergonomic chairs, create a healthy environment at work. Also, silence is probably one of the most productive and healthy factors we believe in. That’s why we try to avoid producing general noise in the office such as loud conversations and (constant) interruptions.


### Health:

We do respect our health. You can stay in good shape thanks to private healthcare, gym membership, fresh fruits or fresh breakfasts in the office. Do you feel like cycling to work? No problem at all, you can safely leave your bicycle in our private garden and then freshen up by taking a shower, we have one in one of our bathrooms. If you happen to catch a cold, you’re not welcome in the office: just to prevent spreading viruses. Take your time to recover at home, if you feel up to - you can work remotely.

Everybody knows that public health care system has its weaknesses. Having that in mind we cover all the necesarry expences that can help our employees to recover faster.

### Our toys:

Oh, we like toys. Our office is equipped with the newest devices and hardware, we’re always up to date with new trends and gadgets. We can finance the device of your choice, simply, tell us about your need.

### Perks:

Actually, it’s hard to list all them all. Quick examples are private healthcare, life insurance, English classes, gym membership, fresh fruits and breakfasts in the office, kindle readers, hardware needed, out-of-office days, pizza-days, and so on.

Our Prograils'es elite Member, Support and Prospect Hoodies are well known, not only in town. We wear our club badges with respect - one for all, all for one.

Should you need a professional advice of the lawyer, it's on us too.

### Office:

We do our best to maintain a good atmosphere in the office. Play Station, VR, table
football and a chill room. Mate energy, soft drinks and a high-quality coffee. The garden,
hammock, ergonomic chairs and electric standing desks. A saturator, a smoothie maker,
and last but not least - a comfortable and friendly office full of plants for sure have an
influence on it.

We like spending time together also after hours, some office parties are labled as epic. When the weather is nice meal in the fresh air is always a good idea: our company's barbecue and garden furniture set helps us to relax. Kids are warmly welcome, we have a small playground too!


### Self-development:

We encourage our employees to self-development, we’d be happy to finance books, e-books (each team member has his own Kindle reader) courses or conferences.

Found self-improving recsources worth buying? Spread the news on our dedicated Slack channel (#self-improvement) and gather together interested ones. We'll make a purchase shortly.


### Reward-them:

Our home-made application called 'Reward them" is a recognition and reward system which primary role is to strengthen the relationship between co-workers and cultivate team identity. Each month every team member receives an allowance (50 points, 1 point = 1 Polish Zloty). Everyone is entitled to dispense 50 points to their co-workers, so theoretically one can gain 50 points per number of team members. This amount can be a nice addition to the basic salary. We're using 'Reward them' when saying 'Thank you' just doesn't seem like enough.
