We guarantee the most comfortable working conditions, everyone is equipped with high-quality headphones, large size adjustable-height standing/sitting desks and as many monitors and other hardware as one needs. Stability balls, adjustable desks and ergonomic chairs, create a healthy environment at work. Also, silence is probably one of the most productive and healthy factors we believe in. That’s why we try to avoid producing general noise in the office such as (very) loud conversations and (constant) interruptions.
