### Team:

We aim not to grow with more than 25 people onboard (the reason you’ll find in ‘Values’ chapter. Right now our team consists of 23 members, so if you’d like to join us, you’d better hurry up.

### Recruitment:

Right now we’re looking for experienced Ruby on Rails developers. If you think you’re a good fit, tell us something about you at hello@prograils.com

### Career:

After joining us, the first three months will be your ‘trial’ during which we’ll see if we understand each other and are we on the same wavelength. As remote working is fine, this is the time you should spend with us in the office. We don’t have any career paths or employer yearly reviews. The rule is simple, you will be properly rewarded for your work, accordingly your commitment and skills.

### Work environment:

Most people hate open spaces, well, we hate them too. Our spacious office is divided into separate rooms, everyone in our office has his own private zone around the desk. We guarantee the most comfortable working conditions, everyone is equipped with high-quality headphones, large size adjustable-height standing/sitting desks and as many monitors and other hardware as one needs. Stability balls, adjustable desks and ergonomic chairs create a healthy environment at work. Also, silence is probably one of the most productive and healthy factors we believe in. That’s why we try to avoid producing general noise in the office such as (very) loud conversations and (constant) interruptions.


### Health:

We do respect our health. You can stay in good shape thanks to private healthcare, gym membership, fresh fruits or fresh breakfasts in the office. If you happen to catch a cold, you’re not welcomed in the office. Just to prevent spreading the viruses. Take your time to recover at home, if you feel up to - you can work remotely.

### Our toys:

Oh, we like toys. Our office is equipped with the newest devices and hardware, we’re always up to date with new trends and gadgets. We can finance the device of your choice, simply, tell us about your need.

### Perks:

Actually, it’s hard to list all them all. Quick examples are private healthcare, life insurance, English classes, gym membership, fresh fruits and breakfasts in the office, kindle readers, hardware needed, out-of-office days, pizza-days, and so on.

### Office:

We do our best to maintain a good atmosphere in the office. Play Station, VR, table football, chill room, mate energy, soft drinks and a high-quality coffee, saturator, the garden, hammock, ergonomic chairs and electric standing desks, smoothie maker, a comfortable and friendly office full of plants for sure have an influence on it.

### Self-development:

We encourage our employees to self-development, we’d be happy co co-finance books, e-books (each team member has his own Kindle reader) courses or conferences.
