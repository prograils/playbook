title: Who we are
---

Hello, we are Prograils: software development and consulting company. We specialize in delivering bespoke, perfectly crafted solutions for individual needs.
In other words? The things we do best: Ruby on Rails, Android and iOS.

## Values ##

What stands us out from the crowd are our values:

Business model: which is personal. Our sales & growth team will never try to pitch you because, simply, we don’t have one. And never will. That’s not our style. If you want to make business, cut the crap and let’s make a business: book the time slot for a call directly with our CEO, Maciej:

Quality: we have high-quality standards in our work: it’s not about the numbers, it’s about the quality. If you want us to deliver something fast and cheap - for sure we are not a good fit for your business.

Transparency: except for the sky, number 25 is the limit. Companies with a growth tend to lose track of what’s going on. That’s why, to avoid chaos, we’ve decided not to hire more than 25 employees. We don’t want to create copro-like structures with teams within the teams. Everyone is equal, everyone is personally engaged.

## Technologies ##

Our core-strength are Ruby on Rails, iOS, Android and Elixir.

On back side:
On front side: React, JavaScript (ES6), Vue, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3 / 4,
