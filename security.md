Following these simple steps should ensure that data stays secure

### Hardware:

1. Always encrypt your hard-drive. In Ubuntu use full-disc encryption, in OSX use File Vault.
2. Do not connect to public WiFi. Never. Anywhere.
   - if you need internet access, take the company’s 3g-router
   - if it’s not possible, use your mobile as 3g-hotspot and just ask for a refund for using mobile data
4. If possible, have Bluetooth turned off. Always have Bluetooth turned off when you’re not in the office or at home.
5. If you’re using Google Authenticator on your mobile, ensure that accessing your mobile phone data is not possible without the password.
   - make sure, that after 10 tries it will auto-wipe
   - ensure that no one can read text messages on your phone without providing the password first (turn off text-message notification on lock screen)


### Software:

1. 2F Auth must be turned on wherever this is possible; ensure that you have turned it on for GSuite, GitHub, Bitbucket, Gitlab and other services we’re using on a daily basis.
2. Your computer must have auto-lock turned on, the suggested timeout is 1 minute. Every team member caught leaving his computer unlocked is obliged to buy doughnuts to the office as penalty compensation.
3. Use a secure password manager, ie. [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/){:target="_blank"}
