Following those simple steps should ensure that data stays secure

## Hardware

1. Always encrypt you hard-drive. In Ubuntu use full-disc encryption, in OSX use File Vault
2. Do not connect to public wifi. Never. Anywhere
  * if you need internet access take company's 3g-router
  * if it's not possible, use your mobile as 3g-hotspot and just ask for a refund for using mobile data
3. If possible, have Bluetooth turned off. Have bluetooth turned off always when not in the office or at home
4. If you're using google authenticator on your mobile, ensure, that accessing your mobile phone data is not possible without password
  * and make sure, that after 10 tries it will auto-wipe
  * ensure, that no one can read text-message on your phone without providing password first (turn off text-message notification on lock screen)




## Software

1. 2FA Auth must be turned on wherever this is possible, ensure, that you have turned it on for GSuite, GitHub, Bitbucket, Gitlab and other services we're using on a daily basis
2. Computer must have auto-lock turned on, suggested timeout is 1 minute
3. Use secure password manager, ie. [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/)
